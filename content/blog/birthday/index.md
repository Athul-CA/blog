> when was the last time someone called to wish you a "Happy Birthday"?

All of us Humans have our Birthdays, this is as true as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west stuff... The universal truth stuff. 

Otherwise if you're a robot, you'll have a manufacturing date. 

We all greet our friends with a lousy "Happy Birthday" in Whatsapp or Instagram (or Facebook) or someother social media platform. This maybe effective in the short term but the level of personalization is nearly equal to 1. 

In my opininon Birthday Wishes should come from the Heart.Rather than a routine Message through Whatsapp, it should come from your words. 

I prefer calling that person on his birthday, it gives a better message that I care and I value you... all that stuff. You took a bit of time to call that friend. It can help you get better with your old friends or relationships. Best of it all, It'll make the person happy since you've called. 

Next Time call your friends on His/Her Birthday in addition to that whatsapp message.
