description: My PErsonal and Mobile Setup for Coding and Basic Stuffs
---
Coding is one of my favorite Hobbies apart from Music and Films.
My system is a Desktop with 4Gigs of RAM and an Intel Pentium Processor with 1024+
160 Gigs of HDD Space.I've got a Windows and Linux Setup in my Desktop. I use Linux more than Windows. The only use for windows is for transferring files from the Pendrives and my Drives.     

#### My Linux Setup
I use *Ubuntu* with *KDE Plasma* as the Desktop Environment which makes it **Kubuntu**.  So The terminal is "Konsole". I use **'Oh-My-ZSH'** rather than the original **'Bash'** as my console. Oh-My-ZSH is so cool and the way we could customize it to our needs.     
#### My ZSH Setup
- Theme is "Norm" 
- Plugins -> Git
- Sometimes I cahnge the Theme to Powerlevel 9k

I've got my Editors as Vim, NeoVim, Visual Studio Code and Atom. VS Code is my main editor while NeoVim is used Second. I use Atom and Vim for extreme cases. I don't check on my windows much so I don't know whats there.    
I mostly use these editors for JavaScript and Python. Occassionaly HTMl,C sometimes React, Django, Machine Learning Examples etc...
