## A Word on CUSAT
CUSAT is a theatre of Dreams. I wish I had studied there so many times but yet I'm so thankfull for being at CEK.   
CUSAT being in top 50 universities across India as by NIRF is in the Heart of Ernakulam, Kerala. Make-a-ton CUSAT was a wonderful experience being my first Hackathon in Kerala. The organizers were awesome and my Teammates were 300% awesomer. 

### The BeforeMath
We were selected for the hackathon by the Organizers. Then my friend Kiran called and asked me if we could team up. I said why not? We could even add my mate Abhinav with us. We made a small whatsapp group called a "Group with no Name". I met my other Teamates Virtually from this group. We were totally excited to go. We made an assessment on our skills and what we should do... My Other Teamates were Bonni who was brilliant in Web Design and CSS, The other was Neenu, she was brilliant at Prototyping and stuff. Kiran and I were good in Django and Abhinav was good in React.   
We planned on something fun and creative and were ready for the Hack.
### At the Lion's Den
You'd surely have a predujiced view on a Hackathon in Kerala like who's gonna come and we'll win the prize for sure and all. I had that view anywaysðŸ¤ª. I went to CUSAT by Kochi Metro with a laptop borrowed from my Cousin just for Hacking. I was met at CUSAT by a great deal of Friends. This Kid Akash Santhosh is the Underrated King there. He's so childish but he works for Amazon as a Network Engineer.
