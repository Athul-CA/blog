_And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry_

_And all you touch and all you see_

_Is all your life will ever be"_

## Coming Back to Life

Pink Floyd, the band of the 70's and 80's which brought mainstream attention to Psychedelic Rock and Progressive rock as a whole is an important part of my daily listening activity. Like most people who love Pink Floyd, there has been days when I listened to just them, various albums, various timelines, various states of mind. Even while writing this sentence I'm listening to "Shine on you Crazy Diamond(Pt 1-5)" from "Wish you were Here" and it's 1:36AM.

I started to listen to Pink Floyd for the first time in 2019, my cousin had told me to listen to them since I loved Queen,AC/DC and Led Zeppelin(Immigrant Song mainly) then. I gave it a try by listening to "Wish you Were Here" then. I was hoping for something so pumped up and dance level since Immigrant Song was something like that and my Pop remix listening brain thought so. Underwhelming as the first thought came in 2019 when I listened to it. Maybe it was the forced liking effort from my side which made me less like it then.

Then I watched 'Person of Interest'. There is a shot where the Machine asks for forgiveness to Harold. The background music actually struck me quite well. I went on to Google and searched for the music with the season and episode number. The music of that scene was "Welcome to the Machine" by Pink Floyd. I really liked that one and occasionally listened to that single song for so much time. I was more into Pop and Regional music then.

FF to 2021 July. I met a senior from College who used to be the Guitar player back then(I'm still in College :see_no_evil:). He actually told me more about Pink Floyd and told me to listen to "Coming Back to Life". I came home and thought why not try it out, so I listened to it on my headphones at Midnight(usual music listening time) and that just blew me away. The more I listened to Pink Floyd, the more I loved it. I still listen to at-least one song from "The Dark Side of the Moon" album(mostly Breathe or Time). It just eases me and gives me enough hope and darkness for to move the day.

## This Irresitable Pasttime

Wish you were here is the most listened songs by Pink Floyd on Spotify. The Guitars in _wywh_ is :sparkles:. Most of my thoughts when listening to Pink Floyd are from a feeling of heartbreak from past experiences. The song was originally made for their the then exited member Syd Barret but me as like most people, enjoyed this song from a romantic perspective. The frequency of listening to Floyd increased after a total breakdown of the emotional side of my brain.
Wish you were here still reminds me of past romantic feelings, how common both the parties were and the ideologies each had.

Mostly the Pink Floyd listening experience can be boosted with a tinge of "Melancholy". Melancholy helps us to understand art in a deeper perspective(I heard this in a Ted-Ed video). This is also true in many examples including music in varying genres, poetry and so on...

Pink Floyd for me was the farcry to soothe the non-existing-non-relationship-friendship-break part of myself with a new music genre but turned out to be the best music choices yet. Pink Floyd is the main reason I'm learning to play the :guitar: (David Gilmour :zap:) and enjoy things without the lost friend.

One of the things that I find funny is that I enjoy the songs made in my Dad's generation while he doesn't.
