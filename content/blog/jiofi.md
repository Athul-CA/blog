JioFi ia a portable wifi hotspot for personal use by Jio. They have somewhat generous plans and are a major telecom provider in India. Jiofi has a web dashboard to display the current details regarding the data usage, battery status and number of devices connected to the network. But I am too lazy to go to the dashboard to check the data out. So I built a small Python CLI to monitor the jiofi device from the network. I call it Jiofi-CLI. You can find the source code on GitHub at [Jiofi-CLI](https://github.com/athul/jiofi-cli). It's easy to install and you can install it with `pip`. The Python Package Manager.

## The Build Breakdown

Before digging in deep, I saw a [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/anandubajith/jiofi-status) regarding jiofi that scrapes data from the dashboard of a Jiofi and this seemed a legit solution for getting the info. So Initial solution which came into mind for getting the data was **Web Scraping**!! üòà. So went on to scrape the dashboard without any prior knowledge in web scraping. I read a few articles on using Beautiful Soup with Requests for fetching the data and parsing the HTML. I went forward with it for a bit and I found out that the data part won't be shown in the scraped output. I was *sad*üòì. I don't have any idea on moving forward without the data. Then the geek inside me woke up. "If the data can't be scraped, then the data has to come from somewhere". A sudden `Ctrl+Shift+i` took me to the chrome developer console.

I spend half an hour tryin to figure out where the data is coming from. Trying the Networks tab finally yeilded some luck. I saw a pattern in the *waterfall* tab in the Network section. About 300+ requests are send in the span of 10 mins. Okay that seems interesting. I checked all the XHR requests and found the motherlode. A series of POST requests were being sent to the JioFi's internal API server. That was a `xxx-form-url-encoded` requests to the endpoint. An internal API‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è. I checked the request headers and saw that a specific keyword was used to fetch the data. These were for LTEStatus, DeviceStatus, WANStatus and so on. I tried to get the data from Insomnia which is a REST Client since Postwoman had shown me a few errors and I was too lazy to fix the errors with Postwoman for that time. Those errors were due to local endpointsand not anything serious. 

It worked on Insomnia, I received the data that was to be used for the web dashboard or in simple terms, I mocked the web dashboard of JioFi with Insomnia. Win üôå Win. The response was like any other API response, in JSON. Here is the sample response.

```json
{
  "Page": "GetLTEStatus",
  "Mask": "",
  "connected_status": "Attached",
  "connection_time": "00:00:57:19",
  "signal_strength": "Normal",
  "operating_mode": "TDD",
  "operating_band": "Band 40",
  "bandwidth": "20 MHz",
  "earfcn": "38750",
  "active_cell_id": "123",
  "plmn": "405 862",
  "apn_in_use": "jionet",
  "gcellid_pcellid": "12345",
  "eCellid": "12345",
  "ecgi": "1234567",
  "rsrp": "-106",
  "rsrq": "-13",
  "rssi": "74",
  "sinr": "9.8",
  "cinr": "not support",
  "tx_rate_total_data_transferred": "11.91 Kbps / 918.67 Kbyte",
  "rx_rate_total_data_received": "359.30 Kbps / 18.31 Mbyte",
  "ul_operator_limit": "50000000",
  "dl_operator_limit": "100000000"
}
```

This JSON response once hooked up with Python will give the precise data. I used Python's requests library to fetch the json from the URL. I divided all the Pages(Page of the specific Keyword, like `"Page": "GetLTEStatus"`) to their respective functions to print the specific data to Stdout. Nothing fancy, just the `print` function of Python.
