description: Secure a GraphQL API in Django with JWTs
---

Authentication has to do with logging users in. This generally involves a cookie if you strictly building a webpage or a header if you are targetting an API. [JWT](https://jwt.io)’s have become an increasingly popular way to authenticate users with an API.
We just learned that authentication is all about attaching a request or session to a user in the database. If you are building against a GraphQL API, chances are that you will be using auth tokens. We prefer JWTs so let’s take a look at one.
## JWT (JSON Web Token)
>An example of JWT:
 eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9.TJVA95OrM7E2cBab30RMHrHDcEfxjoYZgeFONFh7HgQ

This might look like a random bunch of bits, but there is an order to the chaos. If you head over to jwt.io, you will find a nifty debugger that can help you make sense of this token.
A JWT is made up of three parts separated by a period .
- The header contains the algorithm and token type.
- The payload has an identifier for the user sub as well as other metadata.
- The signature is a checksum that is calculated by hashing together the header, payload, and a secret key.

## Set Up / Installation
```bash
pip install django 
pip install graphene_django
pip install graphql_django
```
For JWT Authentication
```bash
pip install django-graphql-jwt
```
### Configuring Graphene Django
On the {django_project_name}/settings.py, add the following:
```py
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # At the end of all the default packages
    'graphene_django',
)
```
### Schema Settings
Set your schema into settings.py
```py
GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': '{django_project_name}.schema.schema',
}
```
> django_project_name == your django project name

```py
import graphene
import {app_name}.schema
```
Query for getting the data from the server.
```py
class Query({app_name}.schema.Query, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass
```
### Create schema
```py
schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query,mutation = Mutation){app_name} == Your django project app name.
```
## Authorization in Django
The concept of authentication and authorization is enabled by default in Django using sessions. Since most of the web apps today are stateless, we are going to use the django-graphql-jwt library to implement JWT Tokens in Graphene.
### Configuring django-graphql-jwt
In the PygraphQL/settings.py file, add a new `MIDDLEWARE`:
```py
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # After django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware
    'graphql_jwt.middleware.JSONWebTokenMiddleware',
]
```
In the same file, add the `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting:
```py
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'graphql_jwt.backends.JSONWebTokenBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
]
```
Creating your query
GraphQL query language is all about selecting fields on objects.

### Using Relay on Links
Graphene has complete support for Relay and offers some utils to make integration from Python easy.Create schema_relay.py into project directory go over the essential changes:
```py
class RelayQuery(graphene.ObjectType):
    relay_link = graphene.relay.Node.Field(LinkNode)
    relay_links = DjangoFilterConnectionField(LinkNode, filterset_class=LinkFilter)
```
- Relay allows you to use django-filter for filtering data. Here, you’ve defined a FilterSet, with the url and description fields.
- The data is exposed in Nodes, so you must create one for the links.
- Each node implements an interface with an unique ID (you’ll see the result of this in a bit).
- Uses the LinkNode with the relay_link field inside your new query.
