description: A small rant on my conversation inability

This is just a small rant on how my flair of speaking got lost. You might think why did I do a whole writeup on this. Maybe it's because what Franz Kafka had said so or I find writing a good way to relieve the stress. 

> “Writing is utter solitude, the descent into the cold abyss of oneself.” ― Franz Kafka

I have missed speaking to people. Even my talking style has changed over the year. I used to be good with people in a conversation, now I find it hard to speak to even my friends. It seems to be the self-induced distancing from people. I feel I have social Anxiety but I doubt it some times. Have I corrupted myself? I have no idea, I have no idea why I'm imprisoning myself on my made up anxiety issues. I can't even have a fruitful discussion on a topic I'm really passionate about. I struggle to present my point all the time in those discussions. I feel like I lost that talkative part of me, but strangely enough if I stop talking most Times people would ask "Why? What happened? Depression aano?"

I had built my identity with my words, my dialect of Malayalam, my way speaking staightforward about stuff. I have lost all these, I'm technically dead now by losing the flair to speak . I became socially awkward. Maybe it's for the good. Sometimes shutting myself out is a good way for wiping the slate clean by being out of the picture, without my dialect to follow.

Sometimes I think I "zone out" when I speak. Feels like a whole jenga stack falls off when I start to speak, a whole cascade with a relations to that speaking thought, which lead to random bullshit in a conversation. This zoning out is crippling me. Even cracking jokes(trying) has become hard.

Thinking to back my Dad's advice "Give a good thought on what you're next word/sentence should be". If I try to do that, I won't be able to talk anymore!!!!
