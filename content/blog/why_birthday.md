Recently I was having a conversation with a friend on Birthdays. Turned out both of our birthdays are on the same month but 1 year and 7 days apart. Then she asked me a question, "Do you like Birthdays?". I was stumped! Out of the rush to send a response, I replied saying "kinda yeah". I passively think about stuff in my conversations.

> "Birthdays were made up by Birthday card companies to sell birthday cards"

The question felt quite thinkable in a lot of sense. Should we celebrate birthdays?

I'm not sure we should. Plus this is my personal opinion.
