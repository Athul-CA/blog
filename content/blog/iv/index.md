description: Travelogue of college life's first trip with my Classmates. The Thrill, the fun, the Family
---
College is hard, like super tough. To have more weightage to attendence than knowldege is the worst thing in College and it sometimes comes hard on you. But with all the worst things in college, the only thing that's good are the classmates and the friends you make. That environment you get when you feel like a family of nearly 50 is something only blessed people like you and me reading this will get. If you feel like you're 12th Grade was better, I'd say be patient and you'll find the difference.   

The thing about college is that it's a big mac sandwich b/w exams, attendence, fest, celebrations, politics and for me Hackathons. The only refreshing time you'll get ,Is a trip with your Class and this was one of the best life decisions I had taken. 

So let me be Santhosh Kulangara for the time being.

## Dec 4, 2019
The University exams started for us and this was the time after 2 weeks since my class had got together and this was too for exams. The First exam was Life Skills and that was for 2 hours. After the exam, we got together in our lab where our IV co-ordinators Abhshek,Jayalakshmi and Jaydev set up a slide show on where our trip would be. I was skeptical about the whole agenda but I trusted my friends. So took a vow on to not do much research on where we'll be going rather I thought like "Go where the wind takes you" level stuff. The first dates were January's Final week

## Jan 24, 2020
The first Corona virus infections were confirmed here in Kerala. As a cautious state who has seen deadly viruses like Nippa and Sikka, the Govt declared the situations as an emergency situation and all travelling outside of Kerala was banned till March final week. 
The IV had to be cancelled just the last minute. My friends were devastated, me having had an experience like this before was sad, but not devastated. Being postponed 5 times, meenhacks had made me went thorugh a lot on the postponment stuff. I had a fear that this postponment will go on and on just like meenhacks.

## Week Between Jan 24 and Feb 14

Discussions went on for when to conduct the IV, I had to take a workshop on 9th Feb at Kochi and that was one of the Best Hackathons I've ever attended. My friends were kind enough to push the date to one more week on Feb15th. We were also having our Annual Tech Fest in College and in between that we had to pull this off

## Feb 14th, Friday
