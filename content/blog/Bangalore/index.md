# Bangalore Hacks
So for the First Time I went to Bangalore and that too for a Hackathon. The Hackathon was so awesome that I love Hackathons now and Apply for every Hackathon I hear about. Plus I didn't like Bangalore much because of its dry nature. Its just Bleh. From a person coming from a **Humid Atmosphere**, it takes time to cope to that one. I'll write all where it started from to most of the details I remember.

### Aug 1st 2019
This was the First Day in the 2nd Year of College. I had the train to Bangalore in the evening of the Day. So I had to get all the prior permissions from our Tutuor and our HOD. Phew, our tutor made me run to our department to another part of the Campus twice. Atleast than run made everything smoother for me.
