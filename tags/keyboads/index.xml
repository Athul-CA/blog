      <description>I am interested in Keyboards, from the title you might&amp;rsquo;ve connected the dots to Mechanical Keyboards and yes I love Mechanical Keyboards. The clickety-clack of typing and annoying your friends(sibiling and family in my case) is so satisfying. I use gateron brown switches on my daily driver but always wanted to experiment on more switch types and keyboards. Sadly I was cut short into this experiment due to the diminishing bank balances and the anxiety of acquiring a new rabbithole-ish hobby which will drain my bank for times to come.</description>
