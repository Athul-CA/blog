      <description>I am interested in Keyboards, from the title you might&amp;rsquo;ve connected the dots to Mechanical Keyboards and yes I love Mechanical Keyboards. The clickety-clack of typing and annoying your friends(sibiling and family in my case) is so satisfying. I use gateron brown switches on my daily driver but always wanted to experiment on more switch types and keyboards. Sadly I was cut short into this experiment due to the diminishing bank balances and the anxiety of acquiring a new rabbithole-ish hobby which will drain my bank for times to come.</description>

      <description>My Desk is a small corner of the house. It&amp;rsquo;s where my system stands, every Eureka moment I had and &amp;ldquo;Why the hell isn&amp;rsquo;t this working?&amp;rdquo; happened. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much unlike the desk showoff counterparts but has quite the basic stuffs which I need. As a college student going to &amp;ldquo;Google Meet&amp;rdquo; my desk setup is more than enough for video calls with the video off as most of my classes do.</description>
