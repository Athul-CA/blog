      <description>I was watching a video about Echoes by Pink Floyd on Youtube and came to know that Waters was inspired by the poem &amp;ldquo;Two Planets&amp;rdquo; by Muhammed Iqbal. I went on to search more about the poem and it goes like this,
&amp;ldquo;Two planets meeting face to face,
One to the other cried, ‘How sweet
If endlessly we might embrace,
And here for ever stay! how sweet
If Heaven a little might relent,</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;For long you live and high you fly
And smiles you&amp;rsquo;ll give and tears you&amp;rsquo;ll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be&amp;rdquo;
- Breathe, Pink Floyd
 Coming Back to Life Pink Floyd, the band of the 70&amp;rsquo;s and 80&amp;rsquo;s which brought mainstream attention to Psychedelic Rock and Progressive rock as a whole is an important part of my daily listening activity.</description>

      <title>The Intern</title>

      <description>Recently I had been an Intern at Frappe. To get more context, Frappe is the company behind ERPNext. ERPNext is an Open Source ERP built on top of the Frappe homegrown Python Framework called Frappe Framework and I don&amp;rsquo;t think many Indian companies have a framework of their own. Frappe is so cool, the people, the philosophy and the values. The People were so kind and helpful and the best of all a great learning experience.</description>

      <description>2020 was hell of a year and I mean that not as an idiom but literally it was hellish. But I learned a lot in 2020. Let it be how to actually drive a car or do Yoga, it&amp;rsquo;s all due to 2020. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been around the Sun for 20 times.As of Jan 1 2021, I&amp;rsquo;m only 20.5 years old.
2020 gave me a new view on life. Too much Kurzgesagt give you an existential crisis mind.</description>

      <description>Let me kick off with a tweet, that&amp;rsquo;ll be better
If you personally know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know which definition suits me, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t, I fall in the former category and that has been one of my failures in these 19 years and I&amp;rsquo;m reluctant to address this single point of failure.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been hearing this since school days and multiple times I tried to change it and I never got cured of it.</description>
