      <title>Getting new Lobste.rs feed with Python and Telegram</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been some time since I written a new technical post. It was because I took a small break from writing code. I have no idea why but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it anyways.
Back to the point, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered https://lobste.rs and found the discussions quite good. But as anyone who writes code, I was lazy to open my browser and navigate to the website. Telegram is one of the major apps I use to get my feed, so I thought why not write a script to get the newest posts from lobste.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Headers; Building a Custom Analytics Server</title>

      <description>Recent days, I have a hard time going to sleep. I have no idea why but it may be because I wake up late or sit in front of my computer all day long. Anyways this sleeplessness paved way for quite a handful of ideas and the most recent one was an Analytics Server. I was heavily inspired by Shynet for its simplicity and aesthetics and I had been using it for getting the analytics of this Blog and a few Personal Projects.</description>

      <description>If you are reading this, I hope you are safe and in good Health
The quarantine is tough. While the time of writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m nearing 3 months of sitting at home and doing stuff excluding college. It was easy at first and now I&amp;rsquo;m all sloppy and don&amp;rsquo;t think about college or studies now. I got to be a bit better at something these these and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of that.</description>

      <title>Shelby, the Shell Prompt</title>

      <description>What??? Shelby is a bash and zsh shell prompt with more focus on improving the terminal productivity while not compromising the speed and size.
Why?? I use the terminal. I use it a LOT. Mostly editing,running scripts and servers. I use zsh because I ❤️ oh-my-zsh. I used to use Spaceship Prompt and it felt like quite slow to me. Then I flipped to Starship Prompt by the awesome @matchai.</description>
