      <description>Recently I had been an Intern at Frappe. To get more context, Frappe is the company behind ERPNext. ERPNext is an Open Source ERP built on top of the Frappe homegrown Python Framework called Frappe Framework and I don&amp;rsquo;t think many Indian companies have a framework of their own. Frappe is so cool, the people, the philosophy and the values. The People were so kind and helpful and the best of all a great learning experience.</description>

      <description>2020 was hell of a year and I mean that not as an idiom but literally it was hellish. But I learned a lot in 2020. Let it be how to actually drive a car or do Yoga, it&amp;rsquo;s all due to 2020. I&amp;rsquo;ve only been around the Sun for 20 times.As of Jan 1 2021, I&amp;rsquo;m only 20.5 years old.
2020 gave me a new view on life. Too much Kurzgesagt give you an existential crisis mind.</description>
