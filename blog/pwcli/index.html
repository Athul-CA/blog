<p>&ldquo;All power is within you. You can do anything and everything. Believe in that&rdquo; - Swami Vivekananda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might be thinking why I started with a quote by Swami Vivekananda. This quote has been a driving factor in my pursuits to learn new things and building stuff and moving forward.</p>
<p>I have been into Go for about 2 months now. I just wrote up two hacks in Go too. One was <a href="https://github.com/athul/shelby">Shelby</a> and now lemme introduce you to <a href="https://github.com/athul/pwcli">Postwoman CLI</a>. As the name says It&rsquo;s a CLI client for <a href="https://postwoman.io">Postwoman üëΩ</a>  in Go.</p>
<h2 id="the-0-">The &lsquo;0&rsquo; üë¶</h2>
<p>Learning either Go or Rust was in my TODO list of 2019. It was only in late 2019, I had reached the mindset to learn Go. I started out on tutorials in building servers in Go. I used to code servers in Python and falled for Backend Programming. I made a bunch of servers in Go with Gin. Go was intimidating at first since it felt more like C to me, but in a few days I got the clutch of it. I still don&rsquo;t actually know most of Go like using slices and goroutines that much. I learn mostly by building so, I learn when I build.</p>
<h2 id="the--1-">The &lsquo;-1&rsquo; üë∂</h2>
<p>I met Liyas Thomas, the author of Postwoman in the official Telegram Group of Postwoman. Since he too was from the state of Kerala, we had a few convos. I had opened a PR to Postwoman when it launched in August-September but it didn&rsquo;t get merged due to my lack of Vue/Js. But later on I had a chat with him if I did a refactor PR. He really gave me the confidence to do that and I did. The PR was reviewed and made changes by the Maintainers of PW and where it started in 1 commit it changed to 8 and the diff was <strong>+8k and -8k</strong>. The PR got merged and I was the <strong>#11 Contributor of PW üéâ.</strong> The PR didn&rsquo;t give me any satisfaction but later after 2 days, Liyas send me a bug and told me to try to fix that. I traversed over 2k lines of Vue code and found the bug. He made a commit and fixed it. This bug squashing gave me much satisfaction than all the contributions I&rsquo;ve done. Later that week, a maintainer and My Friend James made a repo for a CLI in Js. So the idea for making another CLI was basically for learning for me.</p>
<h2 id="the-1-">The &lsquo;1&rsquo; üë®</h2>
<p>So, Liyas gave a Green Flag to work on the CLI. I considered Go as first option since I didnt know how to make one in any lang and Go was fresh in my mind. I built it in almost 2 weeks. <code>pwcli</code> is like <em>httpie</em> with displaying the Request Headers and Status Code and Output Highlighting. The Output is now limited to Json but will add support to HTML and XML in the coming days. <strong>It also has a <code>send</code> feature in which you can give it the Postwoman-Collection.json file and it will test all the endpoints in their respective methods and output the status code</strong>. This was actually a feature request in the Js counterpart of the CLI.</p>
