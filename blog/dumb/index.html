			<p>Let me kick off with a tweet, that&rsquo;ll be better</p>
<p><img src="/img/feynman.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you personally know me, you&rsquo;ll know which definition suits me, for those who don&rsquo;t, I fall in the former category and that has been one of my failures in these 19 years and I&rsquo;m reluctant to address this single point of failure.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing this since school days and multiple times I tried to change it and I never got cured of it.</p>
<p>Even in college and in my community life this has been a hard hitting personal problem for me. But hey I lived this long to tell these to someone else.</p>
<h2 id="the-dumb-stuffs">The Dumb Stuffs</h2>
<p>Long Story Short: I&rsquo;ve got an internship and worked there for a month and they let me go in the first month. I was unproductive and lazy.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t much sad for it. A bit sad yes but I too has faced a lot of rejection and this seemed a bit more straining. Yes I was unproductive and lazy, I know that. I&rsquo;ve never seen a hustling work environment. All I seen are hackathons.</p>
<p>But in this one month span I learned a lot. Starting from SSH-Keys and ending to a deep introspection on life and meaning and failures. I failed a lot, &ldquo;A Lot&rdquo;. For starters I failed in cracking jokes, exams and easier stuffs. This fear of failures pushed me on but at some point I stopped to fear failures.
Most of you would think, &ldquo;Thats good right?&quot;.Yes in a sense and personally it was a huge loss for me. I got studious in school because of the fear that my parents may scold me.</p>
<p>By the Time I got to college studies never have made a fearful. Rather than studies, the Fear of being a Failure haunted me and it still does. I was having a suicidal thoughts regarding the same, but got relieved after talking to my dad about it. It was soo depressing to have a fear like this and then onwards for me it felt like almost every other failure made that fear a bit more to reality bits by bits.</p>
<p>I have trouble sleeping with this fear in my mind. My sleep cycle has lost it cyclical balance and rather has affected my total person. Even when I lost my internship after a month, this fear came back which was dormant for a few weeks that I will be failure and I believe I still am.</p>
<p>Looking back to the past 19 years, All I&rsquo;ve have are some good Friends and other than that I still have no acheivements to be proud of. Rather I&rsquo;ve always been an arrogant asshole in the family and in my community for showing off to people that &ldquo;I know stuff&rdquo; which I don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>One thing I learned while on the internship was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Never be reluctant to ask for help! No one is gonna judge you&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope I could use this advice to be less dumb in the future.</p>
