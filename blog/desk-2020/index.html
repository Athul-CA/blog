			<p>My Desk is a small corner of the house. It&rsquo;s where my system stands, every Eureka moment I had and &ldquo;Why the hell isn&rsquo;t this working?&rdquo; happened. It doesn&rsquo;t have much unlike the desk showoff counterparts but has quite the basic stuffs which I need. As a college student going to &ldquo;Google Meet&rdquo; my desk setup is more than enough for video calls with the video off as most of my classes do. I also watch some of my classes on my Phone. I sometimes write notes about a Topic, it a tad tedious to listen to class and type out the same coming from a Pen and Paper way for the past 15 years of schools. So here they are,</p>
<h2 id="phone">Phone</h2>
<p>I own a OnePlus Nord. I used to use an Honor 9 Lite which I ditched in August 2020, the same time I bought the new one. Strangely enough my Phone and my Laptop has the same memory. 8 Gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of Storage. Bought it myself with Self Earned money from writing Blogs for others. Coming from a 3 + 32 GB phone, the Nord is frikking fast. Better Photos and Fast Charging became my Favorites. I sometimes take Photos on the starry sky.</p>

<h2 id="laptop">Laptop</h2>
<p>I own a Macbook Air 2017. It runs on MacOS Catalina. The new Big Sur upgrade is available but haven&rsquo;t upgraded yet, because I&rsquo;m afraid if it&rsquo;ll break my current apps like catalina did a year ago. The Mac has been with me for a year now. I selected the macbook Air due to my travelling needs. I usually go to hackathons a lot and it&rsquo;s uncomfortable to take a laptop say weighing 2kgs and communting with that. The sheer weight will induce new back problems for me and a person at 181cm height, back problems are really ahrd to cope with.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bhkzivl.jpg" alt="Laptop"></p>
<h2 id="pc">PC</h2>
<p>I own a PC too. It&rsquo;s a 2016 assembled one where I procured the items from a local wholesale shop. It&rsquo;s still running. I had upgraded the ram to 8gigs in April but I seldom turn it own now. It has about 4 linux distros loaded</p>
<ul>
<li>Manjaro</li>
<li>Elementary</li>
<li>Kubuntu</li>
<li>KDE Neon</li>
</ul>
<p>I use manjaro most times when I turn it on. It&rsquo;s filled with Movies by my sibiling who has a good taste for movies.</p>
<h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>
<p>I own a Aopen 19&quot; Monitor. It was too bought from a local shop. Aopen is owned by Acer I guess. I had a plan to move to another bigger one but it&rsquo;s on hold for the time being. May upgrade that after college or after I get a job or have a better economical hold üòÑ.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/DatLqsx.jpg" alt="Monitor"></p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>
<p>I recently bought a mechanical keyboard. I had been waiting to buy one for the past 6-7 months. I&rsquo;m an owner of a Keychron K2. it did cost me quite a bit of money but It was money well spent. I used to own a Logitech k200 for the past 4 years. I had spray painted a few keys of the membrane keyboard for more aesthetics but was went south. The new keybaord is RGB + Gateron Browns + Aluminium frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EnIHlmiXMAAUPoi?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="chair">Chair</h2>
<p>The current chair I use was bought from a local store. Metal Legs and cushioned seats. The one I used before was 20+ years old. It had started giving me a lot of backpain after a coding or workshop session. So went and bought the new one. The wheel base is a boon for me. I don&rsquo;t have to get up and walk a few meters to turn on the Fan or light anymoreüòÇ.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<p>The Apps I use most on my laptop</p>
<h3 id="iterm2">iTerm2</h3>
<p>iTerm2 is my terminal emulator. I use zsh as my basic shell with a custom <a href="https://github.com/athul/shelby">prompt</a> I made a year ago in Go. I sometimes uses NeoVim for file editing.</p>
<h3 id="brave">Brave</h3>
<p>I use Brave Browser to surf the internet. It doesn&rsquo;t show me ads of any sorts and I&rsquo;m really happy about that. It doesn&rsquo;t show ads on Spotify, Youtube or Twitter</p>
<h3 id="vscodium">VsCodium</h3>
<p>I had been a VsCode user for a few years now. I recently switched to VsCodium for a more privacy oriented code editor. I use the Vim emulation plugin for vsCodium for mouse independancy. The other plugins I use are the Golang plugin and Python plugin. I sometimes write Js or HTML and that&rsquo;s it. I have a wakatime plugin to track my coding activity and get detailed stats.</p>
<h3 id="insomnia">Insomnia</h3>
<p>Insomnia is my local API Testing App. It still bothers me that Insomnia is made in electron. It would&rsquo;ve been super cool if it was made in native code.</p>
<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>
<p>For music and podcasts(duh)</p>
<h3 id="telegram-and-whatsapp">Telegram and WhatsApp</h3>
<p>Messaging obviosly</p>
